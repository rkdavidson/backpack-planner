Backpacker Planner
-------------------------------------
#Goal
To assist holistically with the planning process for a backpacking adventure, from gear to food to travel logistics.

#Apps/Tools
An application with a specific interactive/information focus will be called 'tool'.
The core tools are:
    * Menu Planner — nutrition, meals, food and required fuel etc
    * Gearlist — maintain sets of gear to use, iterate options
    * Route — plan day-by-day miles to make, routes, analyze elevation profiles etc

G E A R L I S T
-------------------------------------------

— Create sets of gear, templates for trips ("dayhike", "jmt", "big pack", "no stove")
— Maintain a virtual inventory that reflects your real gear options
— Define goals/constraints like "< 14lb base weight"
— Over time, machine-learning can identify patterns across everyone's gear, recommend and facilitate planning by suggesting gear based on goals/constraints
